The initial idea behind this App was to provide the user with the information needed to decide if its worth going to Tahoe to ski for the weekend by returning a rating based on several weather and traffic conditions.  

This eventually expanded to include surf conditions in the SF Bay Area as well, since the ski conditions are a bit boring right due to it being summer. 

Several bits of info are called from multiple API's and the background images and rating message change based upon the rating that the program spits out. 

This is my first Rails app
